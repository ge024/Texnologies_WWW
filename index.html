                            Dalí was born in Figueras, Spain, a town in the Catalonia region. He was the son of Salvador Dalí Cusí, a notary, atheist,
                            and Republican who supported Catalonia's independence from Spain, and Felipa Domènech Ferrés, a Roman Catholic, who
                            indulged her son's quirky behavior. Salvador Dalí was their second son, the first had died nine months prior and had also
                            been named Salvador. A younger sister, Ana María, was born in 1908. Salvador Dalí spoke Catalan at home but also learned
                            Spanish and French. His mostly happy childhood and adolescence came to an end with the death of his mother of breast
                            cancer in 1921. Soon after Dalí enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.

                            Salvador Dalí and Man Ray Salvador Dalí and Man RaySurrealist artists Salvador Dalí (left) and Man Ray posing for a
                            photograph in 1934. As an art student in Madrid, Dalí assimilated a vast number of artistic styles and displayed unusual
                            technical facility as a painter. It was not until the late 1920s, however, that two events brought about the development
                            of his mature artistic style: his discovery of Sigmund Freud's writings on the erotic significance of subconscious imagery
                            and his affiliation with the Paris Surrealists, a group of artists and writers who sought to establish the “greater
                            reality” of the human subconscious over reason. To bring up images from his subconscious mind, Dalí began to induce
                            hallucinatory states in himself by a process he described as “paranoiac critical.”

                            for the oil-on-canvas painting behind them, The Madonna of Port Lligat (1950). In the late 1930s Dalí switched to painting
                            in a more-academic style under the influence of the Renaissance painter Raphael. His ambivalent political views during the
                            rise of fascism alienated his Surrealist colleagues, and he was eventually expelled from the group. Thereafter, he spent
                            much of his time designing theater sets, interiors of fashionable shops, and jewelry as well as exhibiting his genius for
                            flamboyant self-promotional stunts in the United States, where he lived from 1940 to 1955. Get Unlimited Access Try

                            his oil-on-canvas painting The Madonna of Port Lligat (1950). In the period from 1950 to 1970, Dalí painted many works
                            with religious themes, though he continued to explore erotic subjects, to represent childhood memories, and to use themes
                            centering on his wife, Gala. Notwithstanding their technical accomplishments, those later paintings are not as highly
                            regarded as the artist's earlier works.

                            Salvador Dalí (1942). In addition to his art and writing, Dalí also created a monument to himself, the Dalí
                            Theatre-Museum, in his hometown of Figueras, which opened in 1974 and features art from his collection. The museum was
                            designed by the artist and constructed on the remains of the local theater building, which was destroyed in a fire during
                            the Spanish Civil War. It was also where Dalí had shown some of his earliest art pieces. Dalí was buried under the stage
                            after his death in 1989.
